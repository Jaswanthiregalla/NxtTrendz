Features implemented:

  - Feature 1
    - **User Authentication**
       - A login page authenticates users using a username and password. After a successful login, the user is redirected to the product 
         listing page. Unauthorized users trying to access protected routes (like /cart) are redirected back to /login

  - Feature 2
     - **Products Page**: Displayed a list of products with details such as name, price, rating, and image. The list is dynamically 
       generated using React components and data fetched or provided through mock APIs.
    - **Search Functionality**: A real-time search bar allows users to search for products by name. As the user types, the product list updates 
      instantly to match the search keyword.
    - **Sort Feature**: Users can sort the products by price in ascending or descending order. This is controlled through a dropdown menu that 
      updates the product list immediately.
     - **Filter Options**: Users can filter products based on categories like "Clothing", "Electronics", "Appliances", "Grocery", "Toys" and also 
      by ratings

  - Feature 3
     - **Cart Management**:
       - Increasing or decreasing the quantity of items
       - Removing items from the cart
       - Viewing the total price and item count
       - Cart data remains consistent until the user logs out or clears it
